--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spacecrafter is free open source (GPL) astronomy and Earth science simulation
and visualization software which renders realistic views around our solar 
system in real time with openGL. It is available for Linux/Unix.

Spacecrafter was branched from Stellarium360 in October 2016. Stellarium360 was
branched from Nightshade 11.12.1 in January, 2012.  Our focus is on planetarium 
and simulator use.

Nightshade was branched from Stellarium 0.8.2 in August, 2006.  Their focus was 
on planetarium and simulator use, although desktop use is also supported.
                    http://www.nightshadesoftware.org

You can hit 'm' to bring up the text menu interface.

Bear in mind that some features do not work on the Windows version, namely
time zones and daylight savings related features.  The "external_viewer"
StratoScript command may only be supported on certain planetarium systems.

On a new installation:

- First time startup may be slow and appear to hang, but please be patient.  
  System fonts are being cataloged.

- Spacecrafter will default to fullscreen mode at screen resolution.  
  If you want to change either you can edit your ~/.spacecrafter/config.ini file.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environment
A 3d openGL4 acceleration vide card (WITH CURRENT DRIVERS!) and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys or drag with the mouse to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys or mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the H key for more help.

More help can be found on www.stellarium.org, and in the user guide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most useful configuration options can be set from within the program.

You can however change it by hand in the file located in config/config.ini on
Windows and in $HOME/.spacecrafter/ on a Linux, OSX, or unix system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime diagnostic information is output to the console while spacecrafter is
running. The information can be useful to debug certain Stratoscript calls.
On Windows platforms this information is output to two files, stdout.txt and 
stderr.txt in Spacecrafter's root directory. Windows7 and Vista users must run
Spacecrafter as administrator to enable this diagnostic output. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
