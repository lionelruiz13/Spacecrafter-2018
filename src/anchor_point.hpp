//! \brief Anchor point for the camera
//! \author Julien LAFILLE
//! \date may 2018

/*
 * This class is representing a point in space to which the Camera will be attached
 * The camera has an altitude/longitude/latitude relative to this point.
 * 
 * Any anchor point needs to be able to give three informations to the camera :
 * 	- its position in the J2000 coordinate system
 * 	- its rotation relative to the J2000 and Vsop87 coordinate system
 * 	- if it is attached to a body (and if so which body)
 * 
 * The position is a 3d vector (xyz). The position is given in astronomical units
 * The rotation is a 4x4 rotation matrix. It is mostly used to follow a planet's rotation
 * 
 * It is up to you to feed anything you want into the position and rotation 
 * 
 * These two parameters are updated by the update method.
 * This method is called by the anchor_manager on the current anchor point
 *
