TRADEMARK USAGE REQUIREMENTS

Nightshade is a registered trademark and StratoScript is a trademark of Digitalis Education Solutions, Inc. (Digitalis)

Under the GPL license anyone may make modifications to the Nightshade project source code.  Thus it is important to distinguish between software released by the Nightshade development team and third-party modified versions to avoid confusion.  

If you modify source code in this project and then publicize or distribute your version to others, you may no longer use the Nightshade name.  You can, however, keep the Nightshade name in source files for attribution purposes in accordance with the GPL.  

If you want to use the StratoScript trademark related to a modified version, contact Digitalis directly to discuss.  In this instance we simply want to ensure full portability of StratoScripts to avoid confusion.

Please note that you can change images, data files, and individual StratoScripts (.sts files) and continue to use the Nightshade name.  However, if you distribute your changes with a Nightshade package, we simply ask that you make it clear that you have modified the package.
